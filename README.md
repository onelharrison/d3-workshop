**4. Understand how to complete exercises**

You will find directories named after each key section of the workshop in the
`exercises/` directory. Starter code for the exercises in each section are
found in those section directories.

For example, the first exercise for the _selections_ section of the workshop is
located at `exercises/selections/ex0.js`. Some exercies also have a css file that
is named in the same way (e.g. `exercises/selections/ex0.css`).

**Exercise instructions are found in an exercise's javascript file.**

To see the effect of the code you have written, edit the `index.html` file to
link to your exercise files.

**NOTE**: You can find the solutions to the exercises in the `solutions/`
directory if you get stuck.
